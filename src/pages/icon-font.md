## Font icons

When using icon fonts you must apply the following markup, which includes the  `fa` and `fa-fw` CSS classes.

```html
<i class="fa fa-fw [icon-class-name]" aria-hidden="true"></i>
```

The `[icon-class-name]` can be replaced by any of the font icon classes found on the [font awesome icons page](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/). Your must only use version 4.7.0 of the font awesome icons.
 
 For an example use of icon fonts, see the [services menu page](services-menu.html).
