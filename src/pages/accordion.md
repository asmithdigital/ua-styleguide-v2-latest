## Default

The toggle element `c-accordion__toggle` sits above the first accordion item. The text for this element is dynamically generated by the JavaScript plugin.

Each accordion item contains the accordion title anchor element as well as the accordion content container, as seen in the example below.

Applying the class `is-active` to an accordion item element will open the accordion item on page load.


```html
<ul class="c-accordion js-accordion">
  <a class="c-accordion__toggle" data-expand-all="true"></a>
  <li class="c-accordion__item is-active" data-accordion-item>
    <!-- Accordion tab title -->
    <a href="#" class="c-accordion__title"><h3 class="c-accordion__heading">Accordion 1</h3></a>
    
    <!-- Accordion tab content: it would start in the open state due to using the `is-active` state class. -->
    <div class="c-accordion__content" data-tab-content>
      <p>Panel 1. Lorem ipsum dolor</p>
      <a href="#">Nowhere to Go</a>
    </div>
  </li>
  <!-- ... -->
</ul>
```
